**Purpose and Description**

Chord Builder is an application to help music students learn music theory and intonation without the skills required to play an instrument perfectly. 
Chord Builder allows users to build and play musical chords on a simple user interface, with the goal of reproducing chords played by the app. 

**General Usage**

Use the vertical sliders on the main screen of the application to build a chord note by note. These notes can be played individually by touching the slider thumb for each note or all at once by pressing the _PREVIEW_ button at the bottom of the screen.

The goal of the app is to reproduce musical chords; use the region at the top of the main screen to choose and play chords that you want to reproduce. Chords can be chosen specifically by selecting them on the spinner at the top of the screen or at random by using the shuffle button on the right. The chosen chord can be played by pressing the play button on the left. 

If the spinner does not contain the chords you want to replicate, navigate to the settings by swiping the navigation pane in from the left and clicking _SETTINGS_ â†’ _CHOOSE CHORDS_. On this screen you can select which chords you want to be available on the main screen. A list of the chords that are currently supported in this app is included at the end of this document. 

A variety of other settings including hints, instrument selection, and slider granularity are also included on the _SETTINGS_ page.

The users current progress in correctly reproducing chords can be viewed at the top of the main screen beneath the chord selection spinner or over time by clicking _VIEW HISTORY_ on the navigation pane.
