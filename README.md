# 5chords, PreAlpha
#

This is the very early version I showed in the meeting with an audio fix (i think).
I only added major chords for now, it won't be a hastle to add minor or diminished or whatever he wants.
Also it only have piano/middle octive notes (directory is app/src/main/res/raw).

The Random button will pick a random number from 0-11, get and play the corresponding chord from the chord array.
The Chord button just replays the chord.
The Check button gets the slider notes, plays them, and checks agaisnt the chord notes.
Displays yes/no on one label and the correct slider values on the other.

The fourth slider doesn't do anything, the others have values from 0-18 (3rd octive C - 4th octive F#)
