These notes can be played individually by touching the slider thumb for each note or all at once by pressing the _PREVIEW_ button at the bottom of the screen.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the app is to reproduce musical chords; use the region at the top of the main screen to choose and play chords that you want to reproduce. Chords can be chosen specifically by selecting them on the spinner at the top of the screen or at random by using the shuffle button on the right. The chosen chord can be played by pressing the play button on the left. \r\n\r\nIf the spinner does not contain the chords you want to replicate, navigate to the settings by swiping the navigation pane in from the left and clicking _SETTINGS_ â†’ _CHOOSE CHORDS_. On this screen you can select which chords you want to be available on the main screen.\r\n\r\nA variety of other settings including hints, instrument selection, and slider granularity are also included on the _SETTINGS_ page.\r\n\r\nThe users current progress in correctly reproducing chords can be viewed at the top of the main screen beneath the chord selection spinner or over time by clicking _VIEW HISTORY_ on the navigation pane.\r\n\r\n**About Us**               \r\nWe are students at the University of South Carolina working on our Capstone Computing Project.\r\nTogether we have developed an application that will help music students learn music theory and intonation without the skills required to play an instrument perfectly.\r\nOur goal is to give music learners an easier method to learn music theory.\r\n\r\nCreated by:   \r\nZachary Askins      \r\nKevin Hyun       \r\nTheodore Stone        \r\nDrea Zeagler     ",
